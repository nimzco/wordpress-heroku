== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I find out my post/page ID? =

When you edit a page in the admin you should look at the url. It would be like this: www.mydomain.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=144&action=edit . In this example the number 144 is your post/page ID.

= I updated the plugin but the editor does not give me any option to exclude images =

Please clear the cache of your browser (ctrl+shift+del)

= How do I get the image ID =

Insert it in to the post and switch to HTML. There you can see the attachment id. If you do not need the image in the post, you may delete it from there.

= Please use the support forum of the plugin on wordpress.org =
